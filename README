AACX or AAC eXaminer is an AAC frame analysis tool inspired by LAME's
mp3x. The program is still in its very early stages and is not yet
complete. It requires a PCM decoded copy of the stream and a custom
format log file. A patch to modify FFmpeg into generating the log file
is included with the program.

Happy Hacking,
